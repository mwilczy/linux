title: T-head TH1520 Mailbox Controller

description:
  The T-head mailbox controller enables communication and coordination between
  cores within the SoC by passing messages (e.g., data, status, and control)
  through mailbox channels. It also allows one core to signal another processor
  using interrupts via the Interrupt Controller Unit (ICU).

      Specifies the number of cells needed to encode the mailbox specifier.
      The mailbox specifier consists of two cells:
        - Destination CPU ID.
        - Type, which can be one of the following:
            - 0:
                - TX (Transmit) & RX (Receive) channels share the same channel.
                - Equipped with 7 info registers to facilitate data sharing.
                - Supports IRQ (Interrupt Request) for signaling.
            - 1:
                - TX & RX operate as doorbell channels.
                - Does not have dedicated info registers.
                - Lacks ACK (Acknowledgment) support.
